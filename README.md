# GoPush
## Introducton

GoPush is a message pushing library for Android devices and was inspired by [NoPush](https://github.com/SpongeBobSun/NoPush)

The Android client basicly is the same with NoPush and the server side is written by GoLang so we get a better concurrrent performance.

Also, GoPush is intent to create a free & open-source message pushing service.

GoPush can be deployed on your own server and work along with your own web applications.
